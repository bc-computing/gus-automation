## Dependencies
### Code
- Go 1.15 (for replication protocol code)
- Python 3.10 (for running experiments automatically, calculating stats, plotting data)
   - NumPy
      - Install with ```pip install numpy```
   - PrettyTable
      - Install with ```python -m pip install -U prettytable```
   - Matplotlib
      - Install with ```pip install matplotlib```
- Redis 6.2.2 (for a specific experiment configuration)
### Repositories
- The Gus repository
- The Gryff repository 
  - Note: Both repositories are derived from the EPaxos repository, but have different communication between clients and servers, so it is easier to have two seperate repos.
- The redis repository (for layered experiments)

All of the dependencies mentioned above are preinstalled in the control machine in this [cloudlab profile](https://www.cloudlab.us/p/e8d6e4c44ca475f33c04a9a3f52b3583a49bcbb5). The server and client machines only have the code dependencies installed.

NOTE: While we are in the process of improving our code, the preinstalled repos may not contain the latest versions. Make sure to git pull inside each repo after instantiating the profile.

## TODO
- Finish working on ```run_experiments.py``` 
   - This is is the updated way of running experiments (easier) and can run any number of configurations
   - Gryff not working with fig8 even with proper amount of servers (3)
   - Need to automate fig12 (if possible) as this changes number of nodes
      - May not be possible to automate as different cloudlab profiles are needed for each setup
   - Need to finish plotting, see README.md of ``plotFigs/``

## How to Run
### Setup
1. Instantiate the cloudlab profile above.
   - Be sure to use the Utah cluseter.
2. Connect to the control machine via ssh.
   1. Make sure to include `-A` 
3. Open this repo in the control machine. This repo and others can be found in `/root/go/src`. All repos are stored in root because cloudlab disk images do not save data stored in user home directories.
   1. `sudo su`
   2. `cd ~/go/src/gus-automation`
4. Make sure ``gus-automation`` is up to date.
   - Run ``git pull``
   - If this doesn't work, run ```git reset --hard LATEST_COMMIT``` where LASTEST_COMMIT is the latest commit to the repo on github to update code


### Multiple Experiments - With Automatic Syncing - This is the NEW ideal way of running experiments

1. **Setup config file(s):** On root@control machine, run `python3 set_experiment_name.py EXPERIMENT_NAME` 
   - `EXPERIMENT_NAME` is the experiment name defined when setting up the experiment on cloudlab
   - **Set the experiment name to "test" to skip this step ("test" is the default experiment name)**

2. **Running the experiment:** On root@control machine, run `python3 run_experiments.py CONFIG_PATH CONFIG_PATH ...`
   - Example: ```python3 run_experiments configs/fig7.json configs/fig6.json```
   - Pass in any number of config file paths. Currently all config file paths are under configs. Be sure to modify each config file to desired specs
   - Node delay setup, and experiments (for all 3 protocols) will be run. Results will be in `results` 
   - Need to add support for fig12
3. **Syncing results to local machine:** On local machine, run ```python3 sync_results.py USER@CONTROL_ADDRESS CONFIG_FILE_PATH```
   - On the cloudlab, copy the USER@ADDRESS portion of the ssh command for the control machine for USER@CONTROL_ADDRESS
   - The config file is used to determined the path for the results directory
4. **Plotting:** On local machine, cd to ``plotFigs/`` and run ```python3 plot_figs.py``` to plot the most recent expriment results.
   - Optionally run: ```python3 plot_figs.py [EXPERIMENT_RESULTS_PATH]``` to plot any results.
5. **Client Metrics**: Optionally, print out (or write to file) specified mean and percentiles of experimental results with: ```python3 client_metrics.py PERCENTILE PERCENTILE ...```
   - **Full description of options:** run ```python3 client_metrics [--clear] LOWER_BOUND_OR_SINGLE_PERCENTILE [UPPER_BOUND_OR_SECOND_PERCENTILE] [NTH PERCENTILE]... [-i, --interval=INTERVAL_LENGTH] [--path=results_data_PATH] [--fig=FIG_NAME] [--protocol=PROTOCOL] [--table] [--noprint] [--txt] [--json]```
      - --clear: clears all json and txt files in metrics before writing to any new files
      - --interval=INTERVAL_LENTGTH: set interval of percentiles calculated between upper and lowerbound
         - -i: equivalent to --interval==1
      - --fig:FIG_NAME: include only FIG_NAME
         - can be listed multple times
      - --protocol=PROTOCOL: only include protocol
         - can be listed multiple times
      - --table: prints metrics in table format
      - --noprint: no printing  
      - --txt: saves metrics to text file under metrics
      - --json: saves metrics to json file under metrics
      - Many discrete percentile values can be passed. All but max and min are ignored when interval flag is set. 
      - If UPPER_BOUND is undefined and --interval is set, then UPPER_BOUND=100 .


### Single Experiment - OLD Way of running experiments
#### Standard
1. Modify `config.json` to choose the settings for the experiment that will be run. The file `config_instrunction.md` provides information on each field of the config for your convenience. 
   1. Hint: It is likely that you will have to modify the default communication parameters to get the experiment to work.
2. Run `python3 setup_network_delay_test.py config.json` to create/remove artificial delay between servers. Delay settings are persistent.
3. Run `python3 run_experiment_test.py config.json` to run the experiment.

#### Layered
Documentation coming soon

## Workflow
### Single Experiment
The execution of an experiment can be seperated into two phases: setup and execution. Detailed below is what our code is doing.

#### Setup
In the control machine,
1. Switch to the correct branch depending on if n=3 or n=5. Stash changes if they were made when switching.
   1. There are some pretty important differences between running Gus with 3 servers and 5 servers. Thus, we decided to make two separate branches for n=3 and n=5. 
   2. The difference between running Gryff with 3 servers and 5 servers isn't as much, but for simplicity, we decided to have two separate branches for Gryff as well.
2. Compile the master, server, client binaries.
   1. Both the Gus and Gryff repository binaries are compiled and stored in seperate folders.
3. Create a timestamped result directory.
   1. The directory is named after the current time to distnguish it from the result folders of other experiments.
   2. This directory will contain the output from each server and client machine.

From the control machine, ssh to each server and client machine. Then
1. Create a result folder (with the same timestamp) to store its own results.
2. Create a folder to store binaries.
3. Download the binaries from the control machine.

#### Execution
1. Kill any processes on the client and server machines that are named `master`, `server`, or `client` for safety.
2. Execute master, server, client binaries on their respective machines.
3. Once the client process finishes, kill all master and server processes.
4. Download the logs of each master, client, and server process into the control machine.

Note: I am deferring the automatic calculation of stats and plotting for later. 

### Multiple Experiments
TODO

## Package Design
There are 3 primary python files: `setup_network_delay.py`, `setup_nodes.py`, `run_experiment.py`. These contain functions that are the core of the automation code. 

These primary python files call helper functions contained in the utils folder. 
- `remote_util.py` contains functions for interacting with the client and server machines via ssh and scp. 
- `command_util.py` contains functions that will return commands for executing binaries.
- `git_util.py` contains functions for interacting with the Gus-EPaxos and Gryff repositories.

The auxiliary test files `setup_network_delay_test.py`, `setup_nodes_test.py`, `run_experiment_test.py` invoke the functions in their respective files, `run_experiment_test.py` also calls some functions from `setup_node.py`.
